## MedSchedule App Project
The purpose of this project is to create a general medication assistance app that helps with tracking medication doses, dose schedules, reminders, and refills. This proposed app would allow pharmacy patients to log into an account that contains their prescription information, supplied by and in co-operation with their pharmacy (patient consent is assumed). 

A reminder system will be provided for the patient to set alarms according to their dose schedule, along with a calendar to monitor prescription refills. For patients that have to take five or more medications simultaneously, the app provides a camera tool to assist in collecting medication by using computer vision.  A smartphone would be required to download the app, and an internet connection to update patient information as it changes.

The intended audience are pharmacy patients that have complex dose schedules and numerous daily medications. As the quantity of medications increases for a patient, the more complicated it becomes to organize dose schedules. A high quantity proposes a risk of incorrect dosages or forgetting a dose.
